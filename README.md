# Applied Machine Learning Projects
This is a repository of hobby machine learning projects which covers topics such is Supervised learning (Knn, Kmeans, Decision Trees and SVMs), Unsupervised learning (QLearning) as well as NLP and GPT based predictor.


## Trump Tweet Generator using NLP and GPT
In this fun project I build a Trump tweet generator using a GPT2 transformer from the Hugging Face library

## KNN, KMeans and Decision Trees
In this Problem we are given with two data sets of red and synthetic wines. 
Our task would be to 

1. Identify optimal cluster and cluster the synthetic wines using KMeans :

2. Report classification accuracy using knn on validation dataset using knn.

3. Report classification accuracy using knn on validation dataset using decision trees.

## Estimating ODE Parameters using Linear Regression

The equation of a spring-mass model as show below is given as

We will use linear regression model to estimate the model parameters a, b, and c and compare it with analytical solution.
